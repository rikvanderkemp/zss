# Not sorted correctly

#### Why this error occurred

The values of a design scale variable are not sorted properly. Design scales only make sense if
they're sorted, otherwise the predictability of generated classes is lost.

#### Possible ways to fix it

The error messages prescribes how the scale should be sorted, either descendingly or
ascendingly.
