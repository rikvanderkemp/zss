# Too many values

#### Why this error occurred

Design scales should be limited in length, otherwise there is no point in using them.
The error occures because a design scale variable is configured with too many values.

#### Possible ways to fix it

The error message contains the name of the violating variable and the correct length, 
so find the variable and remove as many values as is required. Find the violating
design scale and shuffle the values around until they're sorted correctly.
